# Directus 7

> DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION (yet)

## Description
This is the work in progress repo of the next major version of the Directus platform (v7.0).

This version is in active development. Do not use this project until it's released later this year.

## Installation
Download or clone this repo and install the npm dependencies.

The application will be distributed in a pre-built state, but has to be compiled from source for the time being.

## Usage
To create a ready-to-host bundle, run `npm run build`. To run the project in development mode, run `npm run dev`.

## Contributing
If you're interested in the current state of the next version of the platform, feel free to clone the project and mess around with it. If you feel like being awesome and want to help out, let us know in an issue on over [on Slack](https://slack.getdirectus.com)!
