# Directus 7

> DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION (yet)

## Description

This is the work in progress repo of the next major version of the Directus platform (v7.0).

This version is in active development. Do not use this project until it's released later this year.

## Installation

We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to manage all dependencies.

Download or clone this repo and install the npm dependencies by running `yarn`.

The application will be distributed in a pre-built state, but has to be compiled from source for the time being.

## Usage

To create a ready-to-host bundle, run `yarn build`. To run the project in development mode, run `yarn dev`.

In order to actually use the application, you need to have a running instance of [the Directus API](https://github.com/directus/api). Head over to the [`directus/api`](https://github.com/directus/api) and install the API.
